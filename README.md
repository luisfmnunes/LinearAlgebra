# LinearAlgebra
Playing with python and linear algebra. Implementing linear algebra algorithms numerically.

This repository should contain a Jupyter Notebook implemented in GoogleColab containing
1. Determinant Evaluation of square matrixes (n x n) by Cofactoring
2. Inverse Matrix Evaluation of square matrixes (n x n) based on Determinant and Cofactor Matrix
